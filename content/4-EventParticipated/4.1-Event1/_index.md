# Summary Report: “AWS Cloud Day Vietnam 2025 – AI Edition”

**Theme & Tagline:** *New Age Vietnam: From Vision to Value* — turning **AI vision** into **measurable value**.  
**Focus:** **Generative AI** with complementary **Cloud** capabilities (data, security, infrastructure, modern apps).

---

### Event Objectives

- Drive **Vision → Value**: tie GenAI to clear **KPIs/ROI** (speed, cost, quality).  
- Present **GenAI reference architectures** (RAG, agentic workflows, data pipelines, guardrails).  
- Define a **practical adoption path**: Idea → **PoC** → Pilot → **Scale** with governance & data safety.  
- Equip **builders/engineers** and **IT leaders** with **AWS best practices** (observability, cost control).

---

### Speakers

- **AWS Vietnam** leaders & specialists (AI/GenAI, Data, Security, AppMod).  
- **Customer** speakers from Vietnam (transformation & GenAI use cases).  
- **Partners** (deployment playbooks, cost optimization, operations).

---

### Key Highlights

#### Central theme: Generative AI on AWS
- **Amazon Bedrock / Amazon Q** & **Guardrails**: rapid start, security, compliance.  
- **Data-first**: **retrieval/rerank/embeddings** quality drives output quality.  
- **Cloud consistency**: build on **AWS foundations** (identity, networking, storage, monitoring) for security & scale.

#### Representative tracks
- **GenAI Foundations & Architecture:** RAG, tool-use/agents, evaluation & observability.  
- **Data, Security & Governance:** PII protection, access control, moderation, cost/token tracking.  
- **App Modernization for AI:** service decomposition, API-first, event-driven; making apps **AI-ready**.  
- **Builders Hands-on:** demos/mini-labs for internal assistants and semantic search.

#### Key messages
- **Vision → Value**: avoid demo-only efforts; anchor to **KPIs** from day one.  
- **Data before models**: optimize pipelines, indexing, caching, and latency.  
- **Safety & compliance**: guardrails, auditability, continuous monitoring & evaluation.

---

### Key Takeaways

#### Design Mindset
- **Business-first**: small, high-impact problems with clear owners & data.  
- **Ubiquitous language**: align business–tech and lock KPIs/ROI early.

#### Technical Architecture
- Prefer **RAG** and **agentic patterns**; separate **orchestrator** from **tools**.  
- **Observability & Eval**: tracing, offline/online evaluation, feedback loops.  
- **Cost & Performance**: fit-for-purpose models, batching/caching, prompt/context optimization, latency control.

#### Modernization Strategy
- Roadmap **PoC → pilot → limited rollout → scale** with **exit criteria** per stage.  
- Build on **AWS foundations** for security, resilience, and scalability.

---

### Applying to Work

- **Shortlist 1–2 GenAI use cases** tied to clear KPIs; prepare **data & access**.  
- Run a **6–8 week PoC** with **go/no-go** gates (quality, latency, cost/interaction, adoption).  
- Ops plan: monitoring, guardrails, **human-in-the-loop**, continuous improvement.

---

### Event Experience

The event offered a clear path to **move from vision to value**: deploying GenAI into real workflows with security, cost awareness, and business alignment. Talks and demos showed how to standardize the **data pipeline**, implement **RAG/agents**, and measure impact to **unlock pilot & scale**.
