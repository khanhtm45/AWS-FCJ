### Coordinators

- **Diễm My** – AWS Team
- **Đại Trường** – AWS Team
- **Đinh Nguyên** – AWS Team

### Key Highlights

#### The Need for AI in Software Development

Many developers are already using AI tools to increase productivity, but challenges remain:

- **Simple tasks work well**, but complex projects face issues
- **Lack of methodology** for integrating AI across the full development lifecycle
- **Quality control concerns** when AI generates large amounts of code
- **Context management** issues with token limits in large projects

#### AI Development Lifecycle (AIDOC) Methodology

AIDOC is not just a tool—it's a **comprehensive methodology** that helps developers work effectively with AI throughout the software development process.

**Core Principles:**

1. **Human-AI Collaboration**: AI assists, but humans validate, make decisions, and oversee
2. **Multi-step Problem Solving**: Break down complex tasks instead of single-shot prompts
3. **Validation at Every Stage**: Review AI outputs before proceeding to the next step
4. **Developer Ownership**: Developers remain responsible for all code quality

#### Three Levels of AI Integration

1. **AI Assistant (2023)**: Line-by-line code suggestions and auto-completion
2. **AI Assistant+ (2024)**: Solves larger tasks, provides solution options
3. **AI Agents (2025)**: Autonomous reasoning, planning, and multi-file generation

#### Key Challenges When Using AI

1. **Single-shot limitations**: Generic prompts produce generic results
2. **Token overflow**: Context limits when working on large projects
3. **Existing codebase integration**: Difficulty implementing features in established projects
4. **Quality assurance**: Ensuring AI-generated code meets standards
5. **Decision making**: Determining what AI should handle vs. human judgment
6. **Context management**: Providing relevant information to AI
7. **Validation complexity**: Reviewing and approving AI outputs

#### AIDOC Workflow

Instead of asking AI to complete entire features at once, AIDOC follows a structured approach:

1. **Understanding**: AI helps analyze user stories and requirements
2. **Planning**: AI generates implementation plans for developer review
3. **Design**: Create logical design and identify affected layers
4. **Implementation**: AI implements approved plans step-by-step
5. **Testing**: Validate outputs at each stage
6. **Review**: Human oversight ensures quality and correctness

#### Amazon Q Developer Demonstration

Toàn Huỳnh demonstrated how Amazon Q Developer integrates into the development workflow:

- **Intelligent code completion** with context awareness
- **Multi-file code generation** for complex features
- **Architectural guidance** for solution design
- **Security scanning** and best practice recommendations
- **Natural language interaction** for problem-solving

#### Developer Responsibilities in AI-Powered Development

- **Validation**: Verify AI-generated code and designs
- **Decision Making**: Choose between AI-suggested options
- **Oversight**: Maintain control over the development process
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure code meets standards
- **Authorship**: Take ownership of all delivered code

### Key Takeaways

1. **AI won't replace developers**, but developers who use AI effectively will outperform those who don't
2. **Methodology matters**: Having a structured approach (like AIDOC) is crucial for success
3. **Human oversight is essential**: Developers must validate, decide, and oversee all AI outputs
4. **Productivity gains are real**: Developers can increase output from 50 to 70+ user stories per month
5. **Multi-step approach works best**: Break complex tasks into manageable steps
6. **Context is critical**: Provide AI with relevant information for better results
7. **Quality remains human responsibility**: Developers are the authors of their code

### Personal Insights

This workshop highlighted how AI is transforming software development from a tool perspective to a methodology shift. The emphasis on human-AI collaboration rather than replacement was particularly important. The AIDOC framework provides a practical approach to integrating AI while maintaining quality and developer control.

The demonstrations of Amazon Q Developer and Kiro showed that AI tools have matured significantly, moving from simple code completion to complex multi-file generation and architectural guidance. However, the key message remains: developers must understand, validate, and own their code regardless of how it's generated.

### Upcoming AWS Events

- **Gen AI Game Day** (Next month): Hands-on competition using Gen AI tools
- **December Competition**: Showcase Gen AI products (10-15 minute presentations)

### Applying to Work

- **Adopt AIDOC methodology**: Structure AI interactions in multi-step workflows
- **Use Amazon Q Developer**: Integrate into daily development for productivity boost
- **Implement validation checkpoints**: Review AI outputs at each development stage
- **Break down complex tasks**: Divide large features into manageable AI-assisted steps
- **Maintain code ownership**: Ensure understanding and quality of all AI-generated code
- **Experiment with AI agents**: Explore autonomous code generation for appropriate use cases

> Overall, the event not only provided technical knowledge but also reshaped my understanding of how AI can enhance the software development lifecycle. The emphasis on human oversight and validation ensures that AI serves as a powerful tool to amplify developer capabilities rather than replace them.

### Conclusion

The AI Software Development Lifecycle represents a fundamental shift in how we approach software development. By combining AI capabilities with human expertise through structured methodologies like AIDOC, developers can achieve significant productivity gains while maintaining quality and control. The key is understanding that AI is a powerful collaborator that requires proper guidance, validation, and oversight to deliver optimal results.
