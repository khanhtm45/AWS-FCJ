### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is very friendly, open, and professional. Everyone is always enthusiastic to help when I need assistance, even after working hours. The workspace is well-organized and creates a comfortable atmosphere that helps me maintain focus. Perhaps it would be even better if there were more social activities or team building events to enhance bonding among members.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The assigned tasks are quite relevant to my major, while also helping me explore new fields that I hadn't had the chance to learn about before. This helps me both review foundational knowledge and acquire additional practical skills.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
Throughout the internship period, I've learned many new skills such as how to use project management tools, teamwork abilities, and professional communication in a business environment. The mentor also regularly shares valuable real-world experiences, helping me gain a clearer perspective on my career path.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The work culture here is very positive and dynamic: everyone respects each other, works seriously but doesn't lack enjoyment. When there are tight deadlines, the whole team works together and supports each other regardless of position. This makes me feel accepted as a real member, even though I'm just an intern.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The company has a support allowance system for interns and allows flexible working hours when there's a need. Especially, being able to attend internal training sessions is a very big advantage.
