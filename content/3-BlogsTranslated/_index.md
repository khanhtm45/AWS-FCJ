This section will list and introduce the blogs you have translated. For example:

### [Blog 1 - Announcing the Developer Preview of DynamoDB Mapper for Kotlin](3.1-Blog1/)

This blog announces the Developer Preview of DynamoDB Mapper for Kotlin, a high-level library that provides streamlined, idiomatic ways for developers to map data between their Kotlin business logic and DynamoDB tables. You will learn how to use the DynamoDB Mapper Schema Generator plugin for Gradle with annotated data classes, understand the preview functionality including supported operations (deleteItem, getItem, putItem, queryPaginated, scanPaginated) and expression types, and get started with code examples showing how to automatically generate item schemas and perform CRUD operations on DynamoDB tables using native Kotlin objects.

### [Blog 2 - Announcing General Availability of the AWS SDK for Swift](3.2-Blog2/)

This blog announces the General Availability of the AWS SDK for Swift, AWS's solution for accessing Amazon Web Services from Swift applications. You will discover how to integrate AWS services into native Apple platform apps, AWS Lambda, and Swift on Server applications with full support for Swift Structured Concurrency (async/await), binary data streaming, event streaming, waiters, paginators, and automatic retry. The article provides a quick start guide with complete code examples, explains the flexible HTTP client options (CRT-based and URLSession-based), and shows how AWS SDK for Swift works across multiple platforms including macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS, and Linux.

### [Blog 3 - Maximizing the value of Smart Machines with generative AI and IoT](3.3-Blog3/)

This blog explores how combining generative AI with IoT transforms smart machines for industrial equipment manufacturers. You will learn about four key use cases: assisted diagnosis and troubleshooting that enriches IoT sensor alerts with AI-generated repair guidance, enhanced field service operations through remote diagnostics and intelligent pre-visit preparation, machine fleet analysis using natural language queries across vast datasets, and AI-generated diagnostic reports for strategic insights. The article demonstrates how to bridge IoT data with generative AI using Amazon Bedrock, AWS IoT SiteWise Assistant, and edge intelligence, along with real-world implementations from AWS partners including KONE's AI-powered technician assistant and HP's intelligent printing factory.
